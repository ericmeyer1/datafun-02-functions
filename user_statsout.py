Descriptive statistics include measures of central tendancy:

   median = 102.50
   mode = 111.00

Descriptive statistics include measures of spread:
   var = 179.25

=============================================================

Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:

slope = 2.78
intercept = 3.12

Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future temperature.

At the future time of hour 13,
we predict the future temp will be 39 degrees Fahrenheit.

How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
